  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>Variables are valuable, because they can store data values and strings. If I wanted to do simple math I could add two variables OR if I wanted to add strings together, I would just concatenate them with variables or other strings. </p>

  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>Naming variables should encompass what the variable is storing. Being specific by saying hairColor instead of hc will serve you or another person reading the code later on when trying to figure out what exactly that variable is storing. A disadvantage would be brevity vs. specificity.</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>Variables will also be used for math purposes, and to even store functions and objects</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>I don't need to use var just yet because var is important as far as scope goes. We use var to declare the variable at the scope it's declared at. If var is done outside of any function and done in the global scope, then it will be recognized as a global variable that can not be deleted.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>If you try to do an alert without first assigning a value to it, then the alert simply doesn't show up. When I attempted this, the program didn't give any error messages -- it just ignored that bit of code.</p>
