  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert() displays a little popup window with the text inside the parentheses. console.log() displays the text in the parentheses in the console.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>alert() could be used to initially welcome a user to a page or to tell the user they are being redirected to another page</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Simply if you keep using an alert, then the user will have to click through EVERY single alert box until there aren't any alerts remaining. </p>
