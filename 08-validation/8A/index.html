  <h1>JS Atomic 08A</h1>
  
  <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
  <p>I liked it better using the while loop because it seemed more efficient.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>Using both would've worked here because the password was hardcoded as a string, but the === would make the password more strict/secure.</p>
